# Unified uploader

This is a basic shell utility to help upload the latest (beta) firmware to your keypad with bre-built binaries. It's made to be as portable as possible and cross platform, so it should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux without the need for any external dependencies. Just click and... pick! Hey, that's pretty good!
