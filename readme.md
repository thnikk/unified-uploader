# Unified uploader

This is a basic shell utility to help upload the latest (beta) firmware to your keypad with bre-built binaries. It's made to be as portable as possible and cross platform, so it should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux without the need for any external dependencies.

## How to use (Windows)

1. Download this repository by clicking the green "â†“ Code" button in the top right and then select "Download ZIP". If prompted, save to your Downloads folder.

2. Extract the zip by going to your Downloads folder, right clicking, and selecting "Extract all..."

3. Click the "Extract" button to extract the archive. Leave the "Show extracted files when complete" checkbox ticked.

4. In the new window that pops up, click on the folder "unified-uploader-master". You can then click on the file called upload/upload.bat.

5. Windows will tell your that SmartScreen prevented an anrecognized app from starting. Click "More info" and then "Run anyway".

6. The script should now be running and asking for a number corresponding to your keypad model. Enter the number and you should be done!
